# RecepionRobot_ultrasound_bluetooth
here I make the rest of recepion robot. 
I make him sensetive to the bodies by the ultrasound sensor. 
When someone stands in front him near him (less than 70 cm) for more than 3 secconds the bluetooth moudle give signal to the screen to switch on & the arms move to a new position .
when no one in front him or they far away the screen turn of by the bluetooth moudle & the arms turn to it initial poition.
#NOTE: In tinkercad there isn't a bluetooth moudle so I switch it to another aurdino .
